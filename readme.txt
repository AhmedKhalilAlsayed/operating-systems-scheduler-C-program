- This is a simple program of OS Scheduler we will make simulation for :

> First Come First Serve (FCFS)

> Round Robin (RR)


- we make some useful files like array_program.c , priority_queue_program.c and queue_program.c
to make our code easy to read




- HOW TO RUN :
you should make all files at the same path
open your Code Blocks
open project

NOTE: the reading file should be with this format : ID_NAME+ID CPU_TIME IO_TIME ARRIVAL_TIME\n
ex :
p0 1 2 3
p1 1 2 3
p2 1 2 3
